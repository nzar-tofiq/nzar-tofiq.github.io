              Placement year as part of my university studies.
            </p>
            <p>
              As well as studying as part of my university course, I was working as part of a technical team, embedded alongside journalists and designers in a busy newsroom. I was working directly on the output of one of the world&apos;s most successful news websites. The work involved fast turn-around short-term projects and tasks in a dynamic production environment, as well as long term projects.
            </p>
            <p>
              This position also required time management, confidence, patience and rigorous testing to match BBC standards of development.

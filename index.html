              Placement year as part of my university studies.
              I was Working in a busy environment, with a motivated and ambitious team, my duties included making small and bespoke applications using modern Web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, SASS, etc.), and learning new technologies in a short time (Ruby, D3, SSI, Node.js, Grunt, Require, Cucumber, AWS etc.).<br/>
              My main duty was to create small applications according to the journalists requirements such as the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-33851439" target="_blank"> Business-quiz project</a> which was translated into 19 languages including some RtL and is still visited and shared by millions of users around the world.<br/>
              The above is one example out of hundreds of contributions, alongside these highly visual projects I also contributed to many automation, further sophistication, backend and bespoke projects using server-side and web technologies such as PHP, MVC, JavaScript, HTML, SSIs and CSS to make the whole working environment and website better.
